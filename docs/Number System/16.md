This lecture introduces sequential circuits in digital electronics and builds up to RS (SR) latches and RS flip-flops using NOR gates.[1]

## Combination vs sequential circuits
- A combinational circuit’s output depends only on the present input and there is no memory element.[1]
- A sequential circuit is defined as a combinational circuit plus attached memory elements that store past output, so the current output depends on both present inputs and past outputs.[1]

## Basic sequential circuit model
- The teacher explains a block diagram: a combinational block whose inputs come from external inputs and from a memory element; the memory stores previous outputs and feeds them back as inputs for the next state.[1]
- Thus, for a sequential circuit, output = f(present input, past output), i.e., state-dependent behavior.[1]

## Latch as basic building block
- A latch is described as the smallest storage element that can hold one bit for some time; it is the basic building block for all flip-flops.[1]
- Latches can be implemented using cross-coupled NOR gates or cross-coupled NAND gates; these gate-level circuits are shown and motivated.[1]

## NOR latch structure and behavior
- The instructor draws a cross-coupled NOR-gate latch with outputs Q and Q̅, where each gate output is fed to the other gate’s input, ensuring Q and Q̅ are complements in proper operation.[1]
- Inputs are S and R (for later RS latch/flip-flop), and the truth table is developed using variables S, R, previous output Qn, and next output Qn+1.[1]

## Truth table and unstable (invalid) state
- The teacher walks through all combinations of S, R, and previous Q to compute Qn+1, emphasizing iterative evaluation of the feedback loop.[1]
- For S = 1 and R = 1 with NOR latch, the circuit enters an unstable or “running” state: outputs toggle or become indeterminate, so this input combination is called invalid or not allowed.[1]

## RS latch and control pins
- S is defined as “Set” and R as “Reset”, called control pins because by choosing S and R values, one can control whether the latch sets Q to 1, resets Q to 0, or holds the previous state.[1]
- The requirement Q and Q̅ must always be logical complements is stressed; if they are not complementary, the latch/flip-flop is not working correctly.[1]

## Types of flip-flops overview
- Four standard flip-flops are listed for later study: RS (or SR), JK (also known as Master–Slave JK in some contexts), T (toggle), and D (data/delay) flip-flops.[1]
- The lecture notes that JK flip-flop solves the invalid-state problem of the RS latch when both inputs are 1; this will be covered in the next class.[1]

## Difference between latch and flip-flop
- Latch and flip-flop concepts are said to be similar, but a flip-flop includes a clock signal, while a basic latch is level-sensitive without a clock.[1]
- Flip-flops are built from latches, so latches are called the basic building blocks of flip-flops; flip-flops are edge/trigger-based, whereas latches respond directly to input levels.[1]

## RS flip-flop with clock
- The lecturer modifies the NOR latch by adding two AND gates in front of the NOR pair and feeding S and R through these AND gates along with a common clock.[1]
- When clock = 0, the AND outputs are 0, so the NOR pair behaves like a simple latch (no change); when clock = 1, S and R are allowed to affect the state, so the circuit behaves as an RS flip-flop.[1]

## Closing remarks
- The session finishes after covering: definition of sequential circuits, latch concept, NOR and briefly NAND latch idea, RS latch behavior with its truth table and invalid state, and conversion to RS flip-flop using a clock.[1]
- The teacher announces that the following lecture will cover JK flip-flop (including master–slave form) and other flip-flops, and encourages students to practice truth tables because many exam questions are directly based on them.[1]
