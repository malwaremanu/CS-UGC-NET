This lecture explains how integers are represented in digital electronics, especially signed numbers using sign‑magnitude, 1’s complement, and 2’s complement forms.[1]

## Types of numbers

The teacher first distinguishes:
- Unsigned numbers: only magnitude is stored, so all bits represent the value and there is no sign bit.[2][1]
- Signed numbers: one bit is reserved for sign and remaining bits store magnitude, so they can represent both positive and negative integers.[1][2]

For signed numbers in computers, three main representations are introduced:
- Sign‑magnitude representation
- 1’s complement representation
- 2’s complement representation.[3][1]

## Sign‑magnitude representation

In sign‑magnitude:
- The most significant bit (MSB) is the sign: 0 for positive, 1 for negative.[4][1]
- The remaining bits store the magnitude in ordinary binary.[4][1]

Example:
- \(+10\) is written with sign bit 0 followed by binary of 10, i.e., 0 1010.[1]
- \(-10\) becomes 1 1010 (same magnitude bits, sign bit 1).[1]

For an n‑bit sign‑magnitude number, the decimal range is:
- Smallest: \(-\left(2^{n-1}-1\right)\)
- Largest: \(+\left(2^{n-1}-1\right)\).[5][1]
So with 8 bits, range is \(-127\) to \(+127\).[5][1]

## 1’s complement representation

Key rules for 1’s complement: 
- Positive numbers: exactly the same bit pattern as in sign‑magnitude.[4][1]
- Negative numbers: take the sign‑magnitude form of the corresponding positive number and complement every bit except the sign bit (0↔1 on magnitude bits).[6][4][1]

Example steps:
- For \(-10\): start from sign‑magnitude 1 1010, keep leading 1 as sign, complement magnitude 1010 → 0101, so 1’s complement form is 1 0101.[4][1]

The numeric range for n‑bit 1’s complement is the same as sign‑magnitude:
- Smallest: \(-\left(2^{n-1}-1\right)\)
- Largest: \(+\left(2^{n-1}-1\right)\), again \(-127\) to \(+127\) for 8 bits.[5][1][4]

The teacher also notes the drawback that 0 has two representations: +0 and −0, because of separate sign patterns, which is inefficient.[1][4]

## 2’s complement representation

For 2’s complement:
- Positive numbers: same as sign‑magnitude (and 1’s complement).[7][1]
- Negative numbers: take the 1’s complement representation of the positive magnitude and add 1 to the least significant bit.[6][7][1]

Example:
- For \(-10\), from above 1’s complement 1 0101:
  - Add 1 → 1 0110, so this is 2’s complement form of \(-10\).[6][1]

The lecture also shows an alternative “direct method” for 2’s complement:
- For a negative decimal like \(-21\), choose a power of 2 just larger than the magnitude (e.g., 32), express the difference in powers of 2, and place 1 in those bit positions and 0 elsewhere to get the 2’s complement pattern.[8][1]

Range for n‑bit 2’s complement is:
- Smallest: \(-2^{n-1}\)
- Largest: \(2^{n-1}-1\).[9][7][1]
So for 8 bits, range is \(-128\) to \(+127\).[10][1]

The teacher emphasizes that:
- 2’s complement gives a unique zero and one extra negative value compared to sign‑magnitude and 1’s complement.
- Because of this and simpler arithmetic, computers primarily use 2’s complement for signed integers.[2][7][1]

## Worked examples and table

Throughout the video, the instructor:
- Converts specific positive and negative decimals (like +10, −10, −21) into all three forms: sign‑magnitude, 1’s complement, and 2’s complement.[1]
- Builds small tables for values like 0, +1, +2, +3, −0, −1, −2, −3, −4, showing their bit patterns in each representation and explaining where students commonly make mistakes.[1]
- Repeatedly checks understanding via questions and corrects confusion about carrying and ignoring the final carry in 2’s complement addition.[6][1]

Overall, the video is a detailed classroom‑style explanation of signed number representations, their ranges, and step‑by‑step conversion methods that are important for digital electronics and competitive exams.[3][1]
