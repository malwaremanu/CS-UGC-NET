This doubt-session lecture mainly revises two key areas of Digital Electronics: (1) arithmetic in different bases (number systems) and (2) implementing/realizing circuits using universal gates (NAND/NOR).[1][2]

## Number system operations

- The teacher revises addition in non-decimal bases (like base 8, base 9, etc.), emphasizing that the sum digit must lie within the allowed digit range 0 to \((\text{base}-1)\); if it exceeds, repeated subtraction of the base is used while counting how many times it was subtracted to generate carry.[3][4]
- Similar logic is extended to multiplication in other bases: treat it like normal decimal multiplication but whenever a partial product goes out of range, repeatedly subtract the base (e.g., 8 or 9) and use the count as carry and the final remainder as the digit.[4][3]
- The teacher also reminds that for addition of numbers given in different bases, first convert one number to the other’s base (or both to a common base like decimal), then perform addition, because base must be the same for direct arithmetic.[3][4]

## Multiplication example in non-decimal base

- Several worked examples show step-by-step base-\(n\) multiplication (like “362 × 5” in base 7-style notation), where each step checks “is result in range?”, if not, subtract the base repeatedly and count subtractions to form carry.[4][3]
- The idea is to generalize the standard primary-school algorithm to any base, with the only change being the threshold for overflow (base instead of 10).[3][4]

## Different-base numbers and conversions

- The session briefly recalls that if two operands are in different bases, one must be converted (using standard base-conversion methods reviewed in earlier lectures) before performing operations; direct operation is not valid when bases differ.[5][3]
- The teacher connects this to exam-style previous year questions, suggesting that many number-system MCQs (including ACCESS-3, BCD etc.) are easily found online and should be first attempted by students themselves.[4][3]

## Universal gates and implementation

- The second half shifts to “how to implement a given circuit using universal gates,” focusing first on NAND (referred to as “N-AND / N-AND gate”) and then similarly mentioning NOR.[1][3]
- The idea of “bubbling” is stressed: to realize a target gate (e.g., NAND) from a given circuit of AND/OR, bubbles (inversions) are systematically placed:
  - If target is NAND: put bubbles on the output of each AND gate and on the inputs of each OR gate in the circuit.  
  - If target is NOR: put bubbles on the output of each OR gate and on the inputs of each AND gate.  
  These bubbles always appear in pairs on a line, because one bubble corresponds to an inversion that must be matched elsewhere.[6][1][3]

## Counting number of NAND/NOR gates

- Multiple exam-style questions are solved where a circuit with AND/OR gates is given and students must find “how many NAND gates” or “how many NOR gates” are needed to implement it.[1][3]
- The teacher’s procedure:
  - Replace each original gate plus its associated bubbles by an equivalent single universal gate block.  
  - Any extra bubble pair added on a line corresponds to an additional universal gate stage.  
  - Finally, count these effective universal-gate blocks to answer “number of NAND/NOR gates required”.[7][3][1]

## Strategy and exam advice

- The teacher encourages students to self-solve MCQs first and, if stuck, search standard digital-electronics MCQ resources (like popular MCQ sites or previous-year GATE/NET sets) before asking in class, to save lecture time.[8][3]
- It is also mentioned that topics like floating-point representation are either low-weight or not usually asked in the targeted exams, so they may be kept for later or just basic theory may be shared.[9][3]
