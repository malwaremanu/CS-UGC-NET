This lecture mainly covers:
- Binary ↔ Gray code conversion and logic circuits
- Binary arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Brief intro to arithmetic in other bases (octal/hex etc.)

## Code conversion (Binary–Gray)

- Binary to Gray:  
  - MSB of Gray = MSB of Binary.  
  - Every next Gray bit = XOR of current binary bit with its previous binary bit.[1][2]
  - Rule: same bits give 0, different bits give 1 (for XOR), so you just compare adjacent binary bits to get Gray.

- Gray to Binary:  
  - MSB of Binary = MSB of Gray.  
  - Every next binary bit = XOR of previous binary result with current Gray bit.[3][2][1]
  - This is also implemented with XOR gates in the logic circuit.

The teacher solves multiple examples like converting 1010₂ to Gray and back, and emphasizes that this binary–Gray topic is frequently asked in PGT, NET, KVS, DSSSB, etc.

## Binary arithmetic operations

Lecture then moves to 4 basic binary operations on unsigned numbers:[4][5][6]

- Binary addition rules:  
  - 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, 1+1=0 with carry 1.[5][4]
  - Multi‑bit addition is done from LSB to MSB using these rules and carrying as in decimal.

- Binary subtraction rules (with borrow):  
  - 0−0=0, 1−0=1, 1−1=0, and 0−1 requires borrow, giving 1 after borrowing.[6][4]
  - Borrow is taken from the next higher bit similar to decimal subtraction.

- Binary multiplication rules:  
  - 0×0=0, 0×1=0, 1×0=0, 1×1=1.[7][4]
  - Long multiplication: form partial products by ANDing with each multiplier bit, shift left, then add.

- Binary division idea:  
  - Similar to long division in decimal: compare divisor with current bits of the dividend, place quotient bit, subtract, bring down next bit, repeat.[8][5]
  - Division by 0 is “not defined”.

The teacher makes students practice many examples for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division directly in binary (without converting to decimal), focusing on exam‑style practice.

## Arithmetic in other bases (octal/hex etc.)

- Towards the end, the lecture briefly shows addition and multiplication in bases other than 10, using the same idea:  
  - Add digits; if result ≥ base, subtract the base and carry 1 to next position.[9][10]
- Example style: adding numbers in base‑8 or base‑16 using “result − base + carry” logic, exactly analogous to the decimal example the teacher revises.[10][9]

Overall, this lecture completes the pending Binary–Gray code conversion, then gives a systematic treatment of binary arithmetic operations and a quick method to do addition/multiplication in any base using carry/borrow logic.
