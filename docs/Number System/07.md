This lecture (Digital Electronics, Lecture 7 – Boolean Expressions) explains minterms, maxterms, canonical SOP/POS, and standard forms of Boolean expressions for 3‑variable functions, with worked examples and K‑map linkage using Hindi explanations.[1][2]

## Core concepts covered

- Boolean expression: Any representation of a logic gate or function in terms of variables (A, B, C, …) using AND, OR, NOT is called a Boolean expression (e.g., A·B̄ + C̄). The teacher recalls that every gate and truth table row can be written as a Boolean expression.[3][1]
- Minterm vs maxterm:  
  - Minterm (SOP side): Product term that contains all variables of the function, each either in normal or complemented form; minterms are “multiplicative terms” (product terms).[2][1]
  - Maxterm (POS side): Sum term that contains all variables, each either in normal or complemented form; maxterms are “additive terms” (sum terms).[1][2]

## SOP, POS, and their nature

- SOP (Sum of Products): First form product terms (AND of literals), then add them (OR). Because product comes first, minterms are called multiplicative terms, and canonical SOP is “sum of minterms.”[4][1]
- POS (Product of Sums): First form sum terms (OR of literals), then multiply them (AND). Because sum comes first, maxterms are called additive terms, and canonical POS is “product of maxterms.”[5][1]
- Notation:  
  - Σm(...) is used for listing minterms present in SOP.  
  - ΠM(...) is used for listing maxterms present in POS.[4][1]

## Truth table link: 3‑variable case

- For 3 variables (A, B, C) there are \(2^3 = 8\) possible input combinations, giving 8 minterms m0…m7 and 8 maxterms M0…M7.[2][1]
- For minterms:  
  - Variable in natural (uncomplemented) form represents 1 in that bit position; complement form represents 0.  
  - Example idea: A·B̄·C̄ corresponds to combination A=1, B=0, C=0 → a specific minterm index.[1][2]
- For maxterms: assignment is complementary:  
  - Natural (uncomplemented) variable corresponds to 0, complemented variable to 1 when mapping to maxterm indices.[4][1]

## Writing expressions from combinations

- The teacher fills a table for all 8 combinations and writes the matching:  
  - For each row, one minterm expression (product of A, B, C in appropriate complemented/uncomplemented forms).  
  - For the same row, one maxterm expression (sum of A, B, C with complementary pattern swapped as per POS rules).[2][1]
- Key rule emphasized:  
  - In minterms, the variable position having 0 appears complemented; position with 1 appears in natural form.  
  - In maxterms, the position with 0 appears in natural sum form; position with 1 appears complemented.[1][4]

## Canonical SOP, standard form, and example

- “Standard form” idea: make every product term contain all variables of the function by inserting missing literals as a pair (X + X̄) in product form, then expanding.[6][1]
- Example discussed (in Hindi notation): a Boolean expression like Ā + B C̄ + A B̄ C is given. Steps shown:  
  - Identify terms missing variables and insert both forms (e.g., for missing B use (B + B̄), for missing C use (C + C̄)), then distribute.[7][1]
  - After full expansion, each product term becomes a minterm with all variables present in either natural or complemented form.  
  - From the final list of minterms, write the canonical SOP as Σm(indices of those minterms).[4][1]
- The teacher notes that this algebraic expansion method is lengthy in exams and suggests using Karnaugh maps (K‑maps) to find minterms and simplify expressions more efficiently.[7][1]

## Canonical POS and maxterm example (sketched)

- The lecture then mirrors the idea for maxterms/POS:  
  - Given a POS with incomplete sum terms, insert missing variables in a way suitable for sums (using identities like B + B̄ = 1 but arranged for maxterm expansion).[6][1]
  - Expand to ensure each sum term contains all variables and then map each to a maxterm index.  
  - From that, write canonical POS as ΠM(indices of maxterms).[5][1]
- The teacher also comments that exam questions are more frequently based on minterms/canonical SOP than on maxterms, so students should focus more on minterm handling and SOP/K‑map usage.[8][1]

## K‑map connection (briefly introduced)

- For the same 3‑variable function, a 3‑variable K‑map is drawn with cells labeled by minterm indices. The minterms obtained from algebra are marked as 1 in the K‑map to confirm which combinations are included.[9][1]
- The instructor emphasizes:  
  - In K‑maps for minterms, put 1 in cells corresponding to present minterms.  
  - For maxterm‑based K‑maps, one would focus on 0 cells representing maxterms, though detailed POS simplification is deferred to another class.[10][1]

Overall, the video is a Hindi explanation class that builds intuition for minterms, maxterms, canonical SOP/POS, shows how to convert a general Boolean expression to standard and canonical SOP (and similarly to canonical POS), counts minterms/maxterms for 3 variables, and briefly connects the result to K‑maps for exam‑oriented problem solving.[2][1]
