This lecture covers half-subtractor and full-subtractor combinational circuits in digital electronics, plus a short recap on implementing logic gates using NAND/NOR.[1]

## Context and housekeeping

- The teacher is continuing a Digital Electronics series (around Lecture 13), after completing earlier classes on adders and basic gates.[1]
- There is some initial discussion with students about class timings, personal schedules, and Telegram group details (GDC Sonipat channel for common portion notes and PPTs).[1]

## Introduction to subtractors

- The teacher recalls that previously adders were studied and now subtraction circuits (subtractors) will be done.[1]
- A subtractor circuit takes binary numbers as input and performs subtraction, producing two outputs: the “difference” bit and the “borrow” bit.[1]
- The terminology is stressed: “minuend” (the number from which subtraction is done), “subtrahend” (the number being subtracted), “difference” (result), and “borrow.” These terms are important for exam questions (PGT/TGT etc.).[1]

## Types of subtractors

- There are two main types:
  - Half Subtractor
  - Full Subtractor[1]
- Half subtractor subtracts one binary digit from another (2 inputs).[1]
- Full subtractor subtracts one digit considering a previous borrow as well (3 inputs).[1]

## Half subtractor: definition and truth table

- Half subtractor is a combinational circuit used to perform subtraction of two single-bit binary numbers.[1]
- Inputs: X (minuend bit) and Y (subtrahend bit). Outputs: Difference (D) and Borrow (B_out).[1]
- Truth table explained with binary subtraction cases:
  - 0 − 0 → D = 0, Borrow = 0
  - 0 − 1 → need borrow, becomes 2 − 1 → D = 1, Borrow = 1
  - 1 − 0 → D = 1, Borrow = 0
  - 1 − 1 → D = 0, Borrow = 0[1]

## Half subtractor: expressions and implementation

- From the K-map or observation:
  - Difference D is realized as \(D = X \oplus Y\) (X XOR Y).[1]
  - Borrow B_out is realized as \(B = X' \cdot Y\) (X complement AND Y).[1]
- Implementation:
  - For D: one XOR gate with inputs X and Y.[1]
  - For B_out: one NOT gate on X and one AND gate taking X' and Y.[1]
- Teacher emphasizes that a half subtractor can be used to subtract corresponding bits, but it cannot handle incoming borrow from a previous stage.[1]

## Full subtractor: definition and truth table

- Full subtractor is a combinational circuit that performs subtraction of three bits: X (minuend), Y (subtrahend) and Borrow_in (previous borrow).[1]
- Inputs: X, Y, B_in. Outputs: Difference D and Borrow_out B_out.[1]
- The truth table for all 8 combinations is discussed using binary subtraction with borrow:
  - Example: 0 − 0 − 0 → D = 0, B_out = 0
  - 0 − 1 − 0 → need borrow: 2 − 1 → D = 1, B_out = 1
  - 0 − 1 − 1 → effectively 0 − 2 → D = 1, B_out = 1 (after explaining with borrow chain)
  - Similar method for remaining rows like 1 − 0 − 1, 1 − 1 − 1, etc.[1]

## Full subtractor: expressions via K-map

- K-maps are drawn for D and B_out with variables X, Y, B_in.[1]
- For Borrow_out, minterms are grouped and simplified; the teacher notes that many groups are singletons, so all terms must be kept.[1]
- A simplified expression for Borrow_out is obtained in sum-of-products form (involving terms like \(X'Y\), \(X'B_{in}\), \(Y B_{in}\)), and then related to XOR structures.[1]
- For Difference, the expression simplifies to:
  - \(D = X \oplus Y \oplus B_{in}\) (three-input XOR, or cascaded two-input XORs if only 2-input gates are allowed).[1]
- Borrow_out is explained in a form that uses complemented XOR term and AND/OR combinations, then mapped to a circuit using NOT, AND, OR gates.[1]

## Full subtractor: circuit implementation

- Implementation steps:
  - Use a three-input XOR gate (or cascaded 2-input XORs) for Difference output.[1]
  - For Borrow_out, use:
    - NOT gates to generate complements where needed.
    - AND gates to form product terms from expressions.
    - A 3-input OR gate to combine those terms into B_out.[1]
- The teacher remarks that exam questions usually ask:
  - Number and type of gates used.
  - Which gates are required for Difference and Borrow.[1]

## Relation between adder and subtractor

- Conceptual link:
  - Adder performs addition; subtractor performs subtraction.[1]
  - Subtraction can also be implemented using adders by adding two’s complement (e.g., \(2 + (-1)\)), so in practice adders are more commonly used and subtractors are less frequently needed as separate blocks.[1]
- Example: To compute \(2 - 1\), input 2 and the two’s complement of 1 into an adder and you still get 1, so the adder effectively performs subtraction.[1]

## Universal gates and implementation counts (NAND/NOR)

- Later in the lecture, the teacher shifts to universal gates (NAND and NOR) and how many of them are required to realize other basic gates.[1]
- NAND as universal:
  - From NAND, you can build:
    - NOT gate
    - AND gate
    - OR gate
    - XOR gate[1]
  - A table is given (for NAND as base gate):
    - NOT from NAND: 1 gate.
    - AND from NAND: 2 gates.
    - OR from NAND: 3 gates.
    - XOR from NAND: 5 gates.[1]
- NOR as universal:
  - From NOR, you can build:
    - NOT gate
    - OR gate
    - AND gate
    - XOR gate[1]
  - A similar table is given (for NOR as base gate):
    - NOT from NOR: 1 gate.
    - OR from NOR: 2 gates.
    - AND from NOR: 3 gates.
    - XOR from NOR: 4 gates.[1]
- The idea of “target gate” (the gate to be implemented) vs “given gate” (NAND or NOR) is explained, and students are encouraged to verify by drawing circuits and using De Morgan’s laws.[1]

## Exam orientation and closing

- The teacher repeatedly highlights likely exam questions:
  - Definitions of half subtractor and full subtractor.
  - Identification of minuend, subtrahend, difference, borrow.
  - Truth tables and expressions.
  - Number of NAND or NOR gates needed to realize a given gate.
  - Identification of universal gates.[1]
- The class ends with general motivational talk, health chat (cold/fever), and instructions that any remaining doubts can be posted on Telegram; future topics will include multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, and decoders.[1]
