This lecture (Digital Electronics – Number Representation, Lecture 5) explains how to represent signed integers in binary using sign‑magnitude, 1’s complement, and 2’s complement, then introduces number extension and weighted vs non‑weighted codes.[1]

## Signed number representations  
- The teacher revises how to represent negative decimal numbers like \(-6\), \(-57\), \(-13\), \(-18\), \(-11\), and small positive numbers like \(+13\), \(+43\) in 4‑bit and more‑than‑4‑bit formats using 1248 weighting (LSB to MSB).[2][1]
- For each example, the sign‑magnitude form is obtained by putting 0 for positive or 1 for negative in the MSB and writing the binary magnitude in the remaining bits.[3][1]

## 1’s and 2’s complement  
- For 1’s complement, the MSB (sign bit) remains 1 for negative numbers and all remaining bits of the magnitude are inverted; the same positive number has identical representation in sign‑magnitude, 1’s complement and 2’s complement.[4][1]
- For 2’s complement, either 1 is added to the 1’s complement or the “direct method” is used (treating the leftmost 1 as negative weight and the others as positive) to read or write the decimal value, with several worked conversions both ways.[5][1]

## Reading 2’s complement directly  
- The teacher emphasizes two views: (a) convert via sign‑magnitude → 1’s complement → +1, and (b) read a given binary pattern directly by taking the last 1 from left as \(-2^{n-1}\) and other 1’s as positive powers of 2, e.g., explaining why patterns like 10101 correspond to \(-11\) in 2’s complement.[6][1]
- Common student mistakes (such as mixing simple binary reading with 2’s complement interpretation or misusing \(2^n\) on already signed numbers) are corrected in detail through repeated recalculation of examples.[1]

## Number extension (sign / zero extension)  
- The concept of “number extension” is introduced: representing a small‑bit signed number in a larger bit‑field, such as putting a 3‑bit value into 8‑ or 16‑bit locations, which is common in computer arithmetic.[7][1]
- Rules are given: for sign‑magnitude, copy the sign bit to the extreme left and place the old bits on the right, filling middle bits with zeros; for 1’s and 2’s complement, positive numbers are extended with 0s, while negative numbers are extended with 1s in the new higher bits.[5][1]

## Weighted vs non‑weighted codes and exam focus  
- The instructor classifies sign‑magnitude and 2’s complement as weighted codes (since their bits have positional weights that allow direct reading/writing), while 1’s complement is treated as non‑weighted because it generally requires extra steps to interpret.[8][1]
- Finally, the lecture notes that sign‑magnitude and 1’s complement are inefficient because 0 has two representations, whereas 2’s complement is efficient with only one representation for 0 and is therefore preferred in digital systems and exams; the teacher also hints that floating‑point representation and Gray‑code/binary conversions will be taken up in later classes.[9][1]
