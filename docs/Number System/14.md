This lecture explains the concept, working, and basic design of multiplexers, with some problems on multiplexer expansion.[1]

## What a multiplexer is

- A multiplexer (MUX) is defined as a combinational circuit that has multiple input lines, fewer selection lines, and a single output line.[1]
- Using the selection lines, the circuit chooses exactly one of the input lines and forwards it to the output. This is why it is also called a data selector.[1]
- A real-life analogy used is that of many trains (inputs) and one destination platform (output), where the route/selection decides which train will reach that platform.[1]

## Inputs, selection lines, and relation

- The relation between number of input lines (M) and number of selection lines (n) is given as \(M \le 2^n\).[1]
- Here, M = number of input lines, and n = number of selection lines. Inputs can be equal to or less than \(2^n\), but not more.[1]
- Selection lines generate \(2^n\) distinct combinations, and each combination can select one input line towards the output.[1]

## Basic 4×1 multiplexer implementation

- The teacher focuses on a 4×1 MUX: 4 input lines (I0, I1, I2, I3), 2 selection lines (S0, S1), and 1 output (Y).[1]
- The circuit is implemented using four AND gates and one OR gate; each AND gate corresponds to one input, controlled by proper combinations of selection lines and their complements.[1]
- Truth table condition: depending on S1S0 = 00, 01, 10, 11, the selected output is I0, I1, I2, or I3 respectively.[1]

## Output equation and enable line

- From the gate-level design, the SOP (sum-of-products) expression for the 4×1 MUX output is derived as  
  \(Y = I_0\bar{S_1}\bar{S_0} + I_1\bar{S_1}S_0 + I_2S_1\bar{S_0} + I_3S_1S_0\).[1]
- The concept of an enable (EN) line is discussed: when EN = 1 the MUX works normally; when EN = 0, no input is selected and the output goes to high-impedance/cutoff (effectively disabling the circuit).[1]
- Enable is usually kept at 1 during normal operation; setting it to 0 is used when the MUX should remain inactive.[1]

## Demultiplexer vs multiplexer (concept)

- A demultiplexer (DEMUX) is described conceptually as the reverse of a MUX: it has one input and multiple outputs, and using selection lines it routes that single input to exactly one output line.[1]
- Therefore, sometimes a MUX is informally called a selector, and a DEMUX is called a distributor.[1]

## Applications of multiplexers

- The lecture mentions that MUX is used for:
  - Parallel-to-serial conversion in communication.[1]
  - Data routing in communication systems and computer memory circuits.[1]
  - Situations where many input lines must share a single transmission line or processing path.[1]

## Multiplexer expansion (building larger MUX from smaller)

- A major part of the lecture covers how to realize a larger MUX using smaller ones, called multiplexer expansion.[1]
- Example: how to implement a 4×1 multiplexer using 2×1 multiplexers, and then how to count how many 2×1 are needed.[1]
- Generic question pattern: “Given k×1 MUX available, make an N×1 MUX. How many MUX are needed?” and the teacher solves examples step by step.[1]

## Example: 4×1 from 2×1

- For a 4×1 MUX target, inputs required are 4; given building block is a 2×1 MUX.[1]
- Two 2×1 MUX are used at the first level (each handles 2 inputs), and a third 2×1 MUX combines their outputs to give a single final output, so total 3 multiplexers of 2×1 type are required.[1]
- From the external view, the composed structure behaves as a 4×1 MUX.[1]

## Shortcut method for large MUX expansion

- For larger sizes (like 32×1 from 4×1), direct drawing becomes complex, so a division-based shortcut is taught.[1]
- Method: repeatedly divide the required number of inputs (e.g., 32) by the available MUX size (e.g., 4), keep track of quotients and the final remainder stage, then add all these counts to get total number of MUX.[1]
- If at the last stage 2 inputs remain and no 2×1 is given in the question, a 4×1 must be used even for 2 inputs; if a 2×1 MUX is available, it can be counted separately.[1]

## Worked shortcut examples

- Example: Design 32×1 MUX using 4×1 MUX. Repeated division and addition give a result of 11 MUX (with interpretation depending on whether 2×1 is allowed or only 4×1 is allowed).[1]
- Another example: 1024×1 MUX from 8×1 MUX, using the same divide-and-add trick leads to 147 (or an alternative split count depending on the presence of a 2×1 at the last stage).[1]
- The teacher stresses understanding both: (a) drawing/implementation for small sizes and (b) quick shortcut for large exam problems.[1]

## Closing points

- The lecture ends by summarizing: definition of MUX, relation \(M \le 2^n\), 4×1 implementation, truth table and equation, enable line behavior, applications, and multiplexer expansion technique with shortcuts.[1]
- In the next class, demultiplexers and further topics in combinational circuits will be discussed.[1]
