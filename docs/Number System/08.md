This lecture (Digital Electronics, Lecture 8) introduces Karnaugh Maps (K‑maps) and shows how to use them to simplify Boolean expressions, focusing on 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑variable maps with worked examples.[1]

## Introduction and motivation

The teacher begins with some general interaction with students, stressing punctuality, sincerity, and the benefit of attending class live instead of watching later, especially for working students who are free in the evening. After a brief recap of previous lectures (Boolean expressions, SOP/POS, canonical forms, and basic minimization), the topic of K‑maps is announced as the next step in simplifying Boolean expressions more easily.[1]

## What a K‑map is and why it is used

The instructor explains that K‑maps (Karnaugh maps) are a systematic, pictorial or matrix‑like method of minimizing Boolean expressions, equivalent to using a truth table but arranged to make simplification easier. K‑maps are especially useful when algebraic simplification becomes difficult and work best for Boolean functions with a limited number of variables (typically 2, 3, or 4 variables for exam purposes).[2][3][1]

## Structure of K‑maps and cell count

For an \(n\)-variable K‑map, there are \(2^n\) cells, and each cell corresponds to one minterm (truth‑table row) of the Boolean function. The lecture shows:[4][1]
- 2‑variable K‑map → 4 cells (A, B) arranged as AB, AB̄, ĀB, ĀB̄ with proper Gray‑code ordering.[4][1]
- 3‑variable K‑map → 8 cells (A, B, C) arranged with Gray‑code order (00, 01, 11, 10) so that adjacent cells differ in only one bit.[1][4]
- 4‑variable K‑map → 16 cells (A, B, C, D) arranged as a 4×4 matrix, again using Gray code on rows and columns to maintain one‑bit adjacency.[2][1]

The teacher emphasizes that K‑maps follow Gray code so that each pair of adjacent cells differs in only one variable, which is crucial for grouping.[5][1]

## Key properties and grouping rules

Several key properties and rules are highlighted:
- Each cell is addressed using Gray code for the variables; consecutive cells differ by only one bit.[5][1]
- Grouping is done only horizontally or vertically, never diagonally.[6][1]
- Groups must have a size that is a power of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., and the goal is always to make the largest possible groups to minimize the number of literals in the final expression.[6][1]
- The map is cyclic (wrap‑around): left and right edges are adjacent, and top and bottom edges are adjacent, allowing groups that wrap around the borders and even corner‑to‑corner groupings.[6][1]

The teacher names each group of 1‑cells an implicant and explains that a prime implicant is a group that is not completely contained within any larger group; exam questions may directly ask for this definition.[5][1]

## Gray code definition

The instructor explicitly defines Gray code as a numeric code used in computing where consecutive integers are represented by binary codes that differ in only one bit. Examples like 00 → 01 → 11 → 10 are used to illustrate how only one bit changes between neighbors and why the sequence 00 → 10 (two‑bit change) would violate the Gray‑code property.[1][5]

## Step‑by‑step examples with minterms

A significant part of the lecture is solving K‑map examples:

1. **3‑variable SOP minimization from minterms**  
   - Given a function \(F(A,B,C) = \Sigma m(1,2,3,4)\)–style set (exact indices as in the video: e.g., 0,1,2,3 or similar), the teacher:  
     - Draws the 3‑variable map with A on rows and BC on columns in Gray order.[4][1]
     - Fills 1s at the given minterm positions.  
     - Forms the largest possible groups (pairs or quads), respecting wrap‑around.  
     - Reads off the simplified expression by identifying the variables that remain constant inside each group (e.g., \(B\bar{C} + A\bar{B}\)–type expressions).[4][1]

2. **Discussion about extra or redundant groups**  
   - The teacher shows that adding unnecessary extra groups increases the number of literals and makes the expression longer, so only essential, maximal groups should be taken.[5][1]

3. **3‑variable example with non‑adjacent 1s**  
   - Another 3‑variable example is given where four 1s are placed in cells that cannot form a 4‑cell group, so only pairs of 2 are possible.[1][4]
   - The final minimized expression is obtained by summing the terms from each pair and avoiding diagonal groupings.[6][1]

4. **4‑variable SOP example**  
   - For a function with given minterms such as \(F(A,B,C,D) = \Sigma m(6,7,11,12,13,15, \dots)\) (exact set as in the lecture), a 4‑variable K‑map is drawn with AB labeling rows and CD labeling columns in Gray order.[2][1]
   - Minterms are marked as 1, and then:  
     - One 4‑cell vertical group is made where possible.  
     - Another 4‑cell group is formed using wrap‑around, reusing minterms if it allows a larger group.  
     - A remaining lone 1 is grouped with an adjacent cell (possibly reused) to form a pair instead of leaving it as a single.[2][1]
   - The minimized expression is read as a sum of products such as \(B + A\bar{C}\bar{D} + BC\) (structure similar to standard K‑map solutions).[2][6][1]

## Naming, implicants, and exam‑oriented points

The lecture introduces the terms:
- Implicant: any group of adjacent 1‑cells in the K‑map.[5][1]
- Prime implicant: an implicant that is not a subset of any larger implicant; exam questions may ask which groups in a given K‑map are prime implicants.[1][5]

The teacher repeatedly stresses that for exam problems students should:
- Carefully construct the map (correct Gray‑code ordering is critical).  
- Aim for the fewest literals by preferring groups of 16, 8, 4, then 2, then 1.[6][1]
- Use wrap‑around groups at edges and corners to maximize group sizes.[6][1]

## Interaction and troubleshooting

Throughout the lecture, there is frequent interaction: students share answers (options A/B/C/D), and the teacher checks them, explaining why some expressions are too long or incorrect. There are also brief interruptions due to internet or audio issues, and the teacher suggests refreshing the stream and even postponing class if connectivity becomes too poor.[1]

Overall, the video is a concept‑plus‑practice session on K‑maps: definition, construction of 2‑, 3‑, and 4‑variable maps, Gray‑code ordering, grouping rules, prime implicants, and multiple worked SOP minimization examples tailored to common exam questions in digital electronics.[4][2][6][1]
