## Summary: Number System Conversion - Digital Electronics Lecture 3

This video lecture covers comprehensive number system conversions in Digital Electronics, specifically focusing on conversions between Binary, Octal, Decimal, and Hexadecimal number systems.[1]

### Key Conversion Methods Covered

**Binary ↔ Octal Conversion**
The lecture demonstrates the pairing method for converting between binary and octal systems. For binary to octal conversion, group binary digits into sets of 3 bits from right to left, then convert each group to its octal equivalent. If the last group is incomplete, add zeros to complete the triplet.[2][3][1]

**Binary ↔ Hexadecimal Conversion**
Similar to octal conversion, but uses 4-bit grouping instead. Each 4-bit binary group corresponds to one hexadecimal digit (0-F). The instructor emphasizes grouping from the radix point in opposite directions for fractional parts.[1][2]

**Octal ↔ Hexadecimal Conversion**
The method involves converting through binary as an intermediate step: first convert octal to binary (using 3-bit groups), then convert binary to hexadecimal (using 4-bit groups).[3][2][1]

### Important Rules Demonstrated

- For integer parts: pair from right to left
- For fractional parts: pair from the decimal point in opposite directions
- Add zeros to incomplete groups as needed
- Number of bits required: Binary=1 bit, Octal=3 bits, Hexadecimal=4 bits[1]

### Practice Problems

The instructor solved multiple examples including conversions with fractional parts, and ended with a homework problem involving finding possible values of X and Y in the equation (473)ₓ = (5Y4)₈. The solution involves understanding that X ≥ 5 (since 4 is the largest digit) and Y ≤ 7 (octal constraint), resulting in 5 possible combinations.[1]
