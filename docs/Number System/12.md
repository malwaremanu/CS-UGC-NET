## Summary: Combinational Circuit - Digital Electronics Lecture 11

This lecture covers **combinational circuits** in digital electronics, focusing on adders as fundamental arithmetic building blocks.[1][2]

### Combinational Circuits Overview

A combinational circuit is formed when logic gates are connected together to produce a specific output based solely on present input combinations, with no memory elements. The output depends entirely on the current input variables, which are binary in nature (0 or 1). These circuits are used in arithmetic and logic units (ALU), data transmission (multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders), and code conversion (binary to Gray, etc.).[3][4][1]

### Half Adder

A **half adder** is a combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary numbers. It has:[2]
- **Inputs**: A and B (two 1-bit numbers)
- **Outputs**: Sum (S) and Carry (C)

The circuit uses one XOR gate (for Sum) and one AND gate (for Carry). The truth table shows four possible combinations (00, 01, 10, 11), producing Sum = A⊕B and Carry = A·B.[5][6][2]

**Limitation**: The half adder cannot add a carry bit from a previous addition, restricting its use to the least significant bit position only.[7][2]

### Full Adder

A **full adder** overcomes the half adder's limitation by adding three inputs: two binary bits plus a carry-in from the previous stage. It has:[2][7]
- **Inputs**: A, B, and Cin (carry-in)
- **Outputs**: Sum (S) and Carry-out (Cout)

The circuit consists of two XOR gates, two AND gates, and one OR gate (or can be built using two half adders). The expressions are: Sum = A⊕B⊕Cin and Carry = AB + BCin + ACin.[4][8][7][2]

### Multi-bit Addition

For adding n-bit binary numbers, the lecture explains that you need **n full adders** (or n-1 full adders plus 1 half adder for the least significant bit position). Each full adder handles one bit position, with the carry-out from one stage feeding into the carry-in of the next stage, creating a ripple-carry adder configuration.[8][2]

The lecture emphasizes understanding which gates are used, how to derive Boolean expressions using K-maps, and practical implementation for exam preparation focused on GATE/ESE/SSC-JE level questions.[9]
